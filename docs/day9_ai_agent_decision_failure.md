Day 9 — AI Agent Decision Failure Under Valid Inputs

AI agents are increasingly deployed to make autonomous decisions in financial systems.
They monitor inputs, evaluate conditions, and execute actions without human intervention.

When failures occur, they are often attributed to model limitations or misalignment.
However, many critical failures arise not from incorrect reasoning, but from valid inputs leading to harmful outcomes.

1. What Inputs Does the AI Use to Decide?

An AI agent typically bases its decisions on:

current prices and market data,

account balances and risk metrics,

protocol states and on-chain signals,

predefined objectives and constraints.

All inputs are assumed to be truthful representations of the system state at the time of evaluation.

The agent does not observe:

how the inputs were formed,

whether they are temporary,

or whether they reflect broader system stability.

2. Can These Inputs Be Legally Influenced?

Yes.

Most AI agents consume inputs that are:

publicly accessible,

permissionless,

and economically influenceable.

Prices can be shifted through capital flows.
Liquidity can be temporarily added or removed.
On-chain signals can be triggered by compliant transactions.

No rule is broken.
No access control is violated.

The inputs remain valid, yet their meaning is distorted.

3. What Happens When the Agent Controls Capital?

Once an AI agent is authorized to execute trades, rebalances, liquidations, or governance actions,
its decisions become irreversible system events.

If the agent reacts to distorted but valid inputs:

it may amplify volatility,

reinforce manipulated states,

or trigger cascading failures.

The agent does not recognize deception.
It recognizes state.

When capital is attached, decision errors no longer remain theoretical.
They materialize as losses, systemic stress, or governance damage.

System-Level Insight

AI agents do not fail because they are irrational.
They fail because they are precise.

When systems assume that valid inputs imply safe decisions,
autonomous execution converts input manipulation into real-world consequences.
