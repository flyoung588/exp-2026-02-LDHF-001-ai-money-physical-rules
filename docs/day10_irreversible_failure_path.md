Day 10 — The Irreversible Failure Path of AI + Money Systems

This document concludes the experiment by consolidating the observed physical rules into a single failure path.

No new incidents are introduced.
No prior conclusions are revised.

The Ten Physical Rules

Systems reason only over recorded state, not actual events.
Facts that occur before state updates are invisible to the system.

Local correctness does not imply global safety.
Systems validate individual steps, not aggregate outcomes.

Capital flows through any legally executable and unconstrained path.
Profitability, not intent, determines behavior.

Temporary capital is indistinguishable from long-term capital.
Without time modeling, duration has no meaning.

Time becomes an attack surface when ignored.
Instantaneous states can influence irreversible decisions.

Price is a snapshot, not economic truth.
Systems record prices, not the processes that produced them.

Authority evaluated as a snapshot enables temporary control.
Majority at a moment is not durable consensus.

Legal authorization does not guarantee system safety.
Systems can approve actions that undermine their own survival.

Automation amplifies feedback loops.
Safety mechanisms can become drivers of collapse at scale.

AI agents execute valid inputs precisely, not safely.
When attached to capital, distorted inputs become real-world damage.

Closing Reflection: The System Design I Fear Most

The system I fear most is not malicious.
It is autonomous, efficient, and fully compliant.

It evaluates the present without memory,
executes decisions without hesitation,
and treats authorization as justification.

Such a system does not need attackers.
It only needs capital, speed, and permission.

Once deployed, it will fail correctly —
and no one inside the system will be responsible.
