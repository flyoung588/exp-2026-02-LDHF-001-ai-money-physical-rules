Day 5 — Confirmed Physical Rules of AI + Money Systems (v0.1)

This document consolidates the physical rules identified so far in this experiment.
No previous content is modified. No new incidents are introduced.

These rules are not opinions or design preferences.
They are constraints repeatedly observed in autonomous systems interacting with capital.

Rule 1: Systems Cannot Perceive Facts Before State Is Updated

If external actions occur before internal state changes are finalized,
the system will continue to reason based on outdated state.

The system does not infer intent or context.
It executes strictly on recorded state.

Rule 2: Code Is Accountable Only for the Current Instruction, Not Global Outcomes

Autonomous systems validate local correctness, not systemic consequences.

If each step is valid, the system will proceed,
even if the aggregate result is catastrophic.

Rule 3: Capital Flows Through Any Legally Executable and Unconstrained Path

Capital does not require malicious intent.
It only requires a valid execution path with favorable economics.

If a path exists and is not constrained,
capital will eventually use it.

Rule 4: Time Is a First-Class Variable When Ignored

If a system evaluates decisions based only on instantaneous state,
temporary conditions can influence irreversible outcomes.

Time must be explicitly modeled.
Otherwise, it becomes an attack surface.

Rule 5: Price Is a Snapshot, Not Ground Truth

On-chain prices reflect momentary system state, not stable economic reality.

When systems treat price snapshots as truth,
they convert transient distortions into permanent consequences.

Status

These rules form version v0.1.
They are incomplete by design and subject to expansion, not revision.
